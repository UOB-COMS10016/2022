This is a brief tutorial on how to setup your personal Apple/Mac/OSX system to be ready for the COMS10016 unit. 
The below steps represent one out of many ways of setting up your system for the unit. Before you start make sure your system is up-to-date with respect to updates and features. 
It is your responsibility to keep your personal system and passwords safe.
To ensure your Mac user has the required permissions, go to "System Preferences &gt; Users &amp; Groups". 
Ensure that your user account is listed as 'Admin', otherwise log in with an Admin account.


<h2>INSTALL THE CLANG COMPILER</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open the Terminal (Mac command prompt). For example, press <b>CMD + Space</b> and type: <code>Terminal</code> then select <b>Terminal.app</b> - a Terminal window will open.</li>
<li>Type: <code>clang --version</code> to see if the C compiler is already available.<br />You should get ONE of the following responses:</li>
<ul>
<li>Information shown such as 'Apple LLVM version 10.0.1 (...)'.<br />The compiler is already installed, move on to Installing the VSCode Editor.</li>
<li><i>OR: </i>A dialogue box pops up suggesting you install the Command Line Developer Tools.<br />Select <b>Install</b> and follow the wizard steps to install these Tools.<br />After this is complete, again type: <code>clang --version</code><br />You should now get output as above, move on to Installing the VSCode Editor.</li>
<li><i>OR: </i>An error showing that the command is not found.<br />Enter: <code>xcode-select --install</code> to start the Command Line Developer Tools install dialogue - follow instructions as above.</li>
</ul>
If the above fails, install 'Xcode' from the App Store on your Mac.
</ol>

<h2>INSTALL HASKELL AND QUICKCHECK</h2>

TODO: Replace with Windows Haskell install instructions 



<h2>INSTALL THE VSCODE EDITOR</h2>
Note that VSCode is the recommended text editor for this unit, but you can substitute it with your preferred editor/IDE if you wish.
<ol>
<li>In your web browser, navigate to: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac</a></li>
<li>Follow the 'Installation' and 'Launching from the command line' instructions</li>
</ol>

TODO: Add extension steps

At this point your system is ready for most of the COMS10016 unit and you are ready to start programming in C and Haskell. Further installations
are optional at the beginning of the unit. However, during the last part of the unit we will use graphics, and for this we will need the SDL2 graphics libraries 
and a Linux desktop environment...

<h2>INSTALL THE SDL2 DEVELOPMENT PACKAGE</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open the Terminal if not already open (see the first few steps above for how).</li>
<li>The simplest (but not only) way to install SDL2 on a Mac is to use the <a href="https://brew.sh" target="_blank">Homebrew</a> package manager:</li>
<ul>
<li>Type: <code>brew</code> to check if it's already installed.<br />
If a 'command not found' error is shown, run the following command in your terminal and follow the instructions, including the commands it tells you to run in the "Next steps" section after the installation finishes:<br />
<code>/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"</code></li>
If you encounter a permissions issue on your device you may want to check out this <a href="https://gist.github.com/irazasyed/7732946" target="_blank">discussion</a>.
<li>Run: <code>brew update</code></li>
<li>To install SDL2, run: <code>brew install sdl2</code></li>
</ul>
<li>Ensure SDL2 is installed by typing: <code>sdl2-config --version</code> (version information should be displayed, such as 2.24.0).</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pkg-config">pkg-config</a> to make compiling with SDL2 easier: <code>brew install pkg-config</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>CHECK SDL2 GRAPHICS</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the program <a href="hellosdl.c" target="_blank">hellosdl.c</a> (Right click/two finger click the link -> Download Linked File As) and save it to your terminal's current working directory (or wherever you want to save it, but you have to change directory in the Terminal to the location of the downloaded file).</li>
<li>Compile and run the program: <code>clang -std=c11 -Wall -lSDL2 hellosdl.c -o hellosdl `pkg-config --libs --cflags sdl2`</code></li>
<li>If the compilation was sucessful, you will see the new executable file <b>hellosdl</b> in the current directory.</li>
<li>Run this program by running: <code>./hellosdl</code></li>
</ul>
<li>If you see a sky blue 'HelloSDL' window appear then SDL2 is working properly.<br />
Setup is complete!</li>
<li>Note that some ports of the SDL library unfortunately have memory leaks, which may be reported back to the terminal...you have to live with it.</li>
